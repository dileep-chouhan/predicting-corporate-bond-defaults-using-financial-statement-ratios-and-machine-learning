# Predicting Corporate Bond Defaults using Financial Statement Ratios and Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting the probability of corporate bond defaults.  The model utilizes publicly available financial statement data and various financial ratios as input features.  The analysis involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation to build a robust and accurate predictive system for mitigating investment risk associated with corporate bonds.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* (Add any other libraries used here)

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`


## Example Output

The script will print key performance metrics of the trained model to the console, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  Additionally, the script will generate several visualization files (e.g., plots showing feature importance, ROC curves, etc.) in the `output` directory.  The specific output files and their names might vary depending on the model and analysis performed.  Example output files might include:

* `model_performance.txt`:  A text file containing detailed model performance metrics.
* `feature_importance.png`: A plot visualizing the importance of different financial ratios in the prediction model.
* `roc_curve.png`:  A plot showing the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.
